# NBA LIVE 2005-08 Windowed Mode

This plugin allows user to toggle windowed mode in NBA Live 2005-08 without any external application.

## Installation

- Download the NO-CD fixed executable for the game you would prefer windowed mode. You need the NO-CD fixed executable as the plugin is designed for a certain version of an executable. NO-CD is also advised as original CD's of NBA Live 2005-08 series unfortunately do not run in Windows 10 and further.

- Download [ASI Loader](https://forums.nba-live.com/downloads.php?view=detail&df_id=13583) and follow instructions in Installation section at its Readme file.

- Make sure you have the latest release from Releases.

- Copy "d3d9.dll", "oledlg.dll" and "plugins" folders from the archive to your game's root folder.
Otherwise, this plugin will not work.

- Copy "plugins" folder to your game's root folder.

- If you have NBAWindowedMode_d.asi in "plugins" folder, remove the file, so the new plugin can work properly.

## Usage

- To enable Windowed mode, make sure WINDOWED value in ``main.ini`` is 1. If you don't have a ``main.ini`` in your root game folder, create an empty text file and rename name and extension as ``main.ini``. If your file name is ``main.ini.txt``, it will not work.
After creating your file, copy the lines below.

```
[DISPLAY]
WINDOWED=1
```

- To disable, you can change the value as 0.
